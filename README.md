# Windows-Install-Media-Deployment-Script

This scripts are for auomated manual install of Windows

This scripts will properly work with original installation media of Windows 10 and Windows 11

To use this scripts with modified install media you may need to modify the specific required script

Older Windows releases are not supported

I am currently working on scripts for LTSB/LTSC install media !

Windows Recovery enviroment is extracted to C:\Windows\System32\Recovery and not into separate partition as on regular install but still will properly work without any issues

Use :

Manual deployment of Windows for end users or corporations

External Windows instalation in external hard drives/USB stick/SD Card (Windows To Go)

Bypass system requirments (Yes this script will allow to install Windows 11 on unsuported hardware)

Case when regular Windows setup wont properly deploy Windows
